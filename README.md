Invasive Species Early Warning System
EcoGuardAi
Overview:
A web-based system for early detection of invasive species using citizen-submitted geo-tagged images, ML-based identification, and cluster mapping to enable rapid alerts and informed response.

Problem:
Invasive species spread quickly, and traditional monitoring is slow. Citizen sightings are underutilized.

Solution:

Upload geo-tagged images via a web portal

ML predicts species with confidence scores

Automated alerts for high-risk sightings

Admin verification for accuracy

Interactive map visualizes clusters and hotspots

Tech Stack:
Python, Flask/Django, Keras, React, PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap

Status:
Citizen submission ✅ | ML detection ✅ | Alerts ✅ | Admin verification ✅ | Cluster mapping ⚠️ Partial

Future:
Satellite data integration, mobile app, improved ML accuracy
